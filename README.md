#   InvestiWise: A sustainable investment dashboard 
# 📈 Mastering Investment Risk Prediction with ESG, Finance and News Insight

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning system that predicts investment risk by integrating financial metrics along with ESG scores and news sentiment analysis. The system uses advanced data science techniques, combining financial data with sentiment analysis from news articles to provide reliable investment risk predictions. 

## Key Features

- **📊 Financial Data Analysis**: Integrating various financial metrics, including EPS Growth, Beta, ESG Scores, and country related value (COUNTRY_RISK_MARKET_RETURN, COUNTRY_RISK_PREMIUM, COUNTRY_RISK_RFR).
  
- **📰 Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing a pre-trained DistilBERT model to perform sentiment analysis on news articles, classifying them into negative, neutral, and positive categories.
  
- **🤖 Machine Learning Models**: Developing models to predict credit rating impact and news sentiment scores. Combining these predictions with financial metrics to predict overall investment risk. Implementing classification algorithms and DistilBERT for sentiment analysis.


- **🚀 Deployment**: Using Streamlit and ngrok
